# AGENTS

## Brand Colors
- **White** (`#fff`) for page backgrounds.
- **Black** (`#000`) for text and borders.
- **Neutral Gray** (`#e0e0e0`) for subtle accents and surfaces.

## Fonts
- Use **"Goudy Bookletter 1911"**, falling back to Georgia and "Times New Roman", for body text.
- Use **"Inter"** (with system fallbacks) for navigation, labels, and interface elements.

## Number Styling
- All numerical markers must appear inside a circle using the `.number-circle` class.
- Circles use a `2px` solid black border and `50%` border radius.
- Keep this style when adding new lines or collections to maintain brand consistency.
